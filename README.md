# Dice Throw

This is a simple command-line application where the player can simulate a dice throw. The player can enter a code that specifies how many times the dice should be thrown and what kind of dice should be used. The player can also add or subtract a number from the sum of the throws.

## Usage

To use this application, simply download the `dice_throw.py` file and run it with Python 3.

The player needs to enter a code in the following format: `number_of_throws D dice_type [+ or - number]`. For example, the code `2D8+16` means that the player wants to throw a dice with 8 sides two times and add 16 to the sum of the throws.

The program will print the results of the throws and the final sum of the throws with the added or subtracted number.
